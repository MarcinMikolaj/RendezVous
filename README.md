### Introduction

This project is a dating app. Each visitor to the application can create an account and then log in to the user panel.

The application will show us other users and information about them with whom we can pair. Whether we reject a given user or accept it depends on us.

The application allows you to display the candidates offered to us depending on our preferences regarding e.g. distance, age range, gender, etc.

You can exchange messages in real time with each user you pair up with. Messages are saved and displayed, so you don't have to worry about losing them after logging out.
